<string id="ExplainCastle_3">TOM SIMPKINS: This tab displays your treasury. Here you set taxes, buy servants and receive information about income and expenses.</string>
<string id="ExplainCastle_4">TOM SIMPKINS: This tab switches to banquets. Lavish celebrations cost you lots of money but your honor will benefit from this.</string>

<string id="ExplainCastle_6">TOM SIMPKINS: This button allows you to set {scarlet}collection points {white}. Troops produced in buildings will run to the position. In the case of the castle, servants {scarlet} will automatically mine resources.</string>

<string id="ExplainCastle_9">TOM SIMPKINS: Well done! Future trained servants will go to the marked position!</string>
<string id="ExplainCastle_10">TOM SIMPKINS: Now it's time to choose your noble. {scarlet} You can't obtain new ranks without a noble! {white}If the noble falls in battle, {scarlet} you will find him or her in front of your castle.</string>

<string id="ExplainUnit_6">TOM SIMPKINS: This meter indicates the captain's health.</string>
<string id="ExplainUnit_7">TOM SIMPKINS: On this line you can see which activity your unit is doing and how much endurance they have.</string>
<string id="ExplainUnit_8">TOM SIMPKINS: Endurance determinates {scarlet}how well a unit fairs in battle.{white} The Endurance is stated by the little face. The happier it is, the more endurance is left. Your noble {scarlet}will not be affected by endurance.</string>
<string id="ExplainUnit_9">TOM SIMPKINS: Activities provide information about whether a unit exhaust or replenish their endurance. {scarlet}If the unit stands still, their endurance is regenerating. If it is running or fighting endurance is consumed.{white} Your serfs also consume endurance when they are working.</string>
<string id="ExplainUnit_10">TOM SIMPKINS: You can order all of your units at once to march instead of run. They will move not as fast, {scarlet}but they will not get tired.</string>
<string id="ExplainUnit_11">TOM SIMPKINS: Diese Zahlen geben die Truppenst채rke an. Fast alle Milit채reinheiten und Kerberos verf체gen 체ber Soldaten.</string>

<string id="ExplainManage_1">TOM SIMPKINS: It is time for me to explain how to manage your castle.</string>
<string id="ExplainManage_2">TOM SIMPKINS: Your buildings are still being constructed by serfs. Some buildings are tied to a title. {scarlet} You can see the conditions in the tooltip. {white} Similarly, technologies and other elements are tied to the title.</string>
<string id="ExplainManage_3">TOM SIMPKINS: Buy more serfs until you have at least 18 of them! Assign them tasks as you see fit.</string>
<string id="ExplainManage_4">TOM SIMPKINS: Not far from your castle, there is a clay deposit. Lets start by mining it. Build a clay pit at the marked location!</string>
<string id="ExplainManage_5">TOM SIMPKINS: Look, the miners are coming to the castle. But what is this? They are not satisfied! If this continues, they will leave very quickly! Do not make the mistake of underestimating the common folk!</string>
<string id="ExplainManage_6">TOM SIMPKINS: Quickly, provide them with house and home! If they can fill their bellies and rest their weary bones, they will be more satisfied.</string>
<string id="ExplainManage_7">TOM SIMPKINS: That looks better! In farms, taverns, and residences, you can make adjustments that {scarlet} affect popularity and honor, but also impact the stamina of the workers!</string>
<string id="ExplainManage_8">TOM SIMPKINS: Try to balance the deductions to popularity on payday and attract a total of 15 workers (not serfs)!</string>
<string id="ExplainManage_9">TOM SIMPKINS: The new workers bring fresh gold into your citys coffers. Finances that you will sorely need to raise troops. But as a regular noble, you can only arm your serfs and recruit spearmen.</string>
<string id="ExplainManage_10">TOM SIMPKINS: Elevate your noble to the rank of Castellan!</string>
<string id="ExplainManage_11">TOM SIMPKINS: Each rank brings new rights and duties. For the noble, an additional ability can be chosen at each rank: {scarlet}Castellan, Baron, and Duke.{white}</string>
<string id="ExplainManage_12">TOM SIMPKINS: Now select your castle and unlock a new ability for the noble!</string>
<string id="ExplainManage_13">TOM SIMPKINS: The people will be increasingly difficult to satisfy. {scarlet}Soon you will have to deal with law enforcement and pest control!</string>
<string id="ExplainManage_14">TOM SIMPKINS: Workers will {scarlet}break the law.{white} Failing to catch criminals quickly {scarlet}ruins your popularity! {white}Try to catch them quickly. {scarlet}Have armed serfs patrol or build watchtowers!</string>

<string id="ExplainManage_16">TOM SIMPKINS: To get rid of rats, {scarlet}you must upgrade your watchtowers to falconry towers.{white} A falcon can keep a large area around the tower clean.</string>

<string id="ExplainManage_18">TOM SIMPKINS: Now elevate your noble to the next higher rank.</string>
<string id="ExplainManage_19">TOM SIMPKINS: Your Grace, if we continue like this, we will soon have no room for more subjects. You should next expand the castle!</string>
<string id="ExplainManage_20">TOM SIMPKINS: Now build a university. As I explained before, scholars produce essential knowledge without which you cannot research!</string>
<string id="ExplainManage_21">TOM SIMPKINS: Have you noticed that this is a good spot for fortifications like palisades or walls? {scarlet}Palisades and walls can only be built on these construction sites.{white} Keep this in mind.</string>
<string id="ExplainManage_22">TOM SIMPKINS: Excellent! Now the most important buildings should be present to kickstart your economy. But do not forget to build more buildings and continue promoting your noble.</string>

<string id="ExplainRecruit_1">TOM SIMPKINS: Soldiers are recruited in barracks and similar buildings. Build a barracks to recruit your own troops!</string>
<string id="ExplainRecruit_2">TOM SIMPKINS: Wonderful! Through the barracks you are now in a position to recruit your first soldiers. They are weak but cheap and can be thrown into battle en masse.</string>
<string id="ExplainRecruit_3">TOM SIMPKINS: Recruit 3 squads of soldiers!</string>
<string id="ExplainRecruit_4">TOM SIMPKINS: Because you now call a recruitment building your own, {scarlet}you are now able to build a mercenary camp. {white}In the mercenary camp, {scarlet}you can hire special troops of other Nobles for a hefty surcharge. {white}However, you still have to meet the recruitment requirements.</string>
<string id="ExplainRecruit_5">TOM SIMPKINS: You'll need your new troops soon. {scarlet}The highwaymen have taken notice of us and are planning an attack on your castle! {white}The opportunity to apply what you have learned!</string>

<string id="ExplainTrap_1">TOM SIMPKINS: Your Highness, one of your men has stumbeled into an enemies trap. Those contraptions are belonging to the most treacherous weapons in a Nobles arsenal! {scarlet}You can uncover traps with your thieves!</string>
<string id="ExplainTrap_2">TOM SIMPKINS: Maybe you should consider traps too. {scarlet}Serfs can build traps. The traps will be hidden from the enemy. {white}But if Sir William is happening to ask, I didn't told you that.</string>

<string id="ExplainScout_1">TOM SIMPKINS: Look, we have discovered hidden resources! You can not exploit this resources right away, Your Highness.</string>
